# Algebra-Linear-Equations
  -This C program calculates the slope of a line given two points and displays the point-slope equation. It allows users to input `x` and `y` values. The program saves the         results to a file named `Linear_equations_algebra.txt`.

## Planned Updates
  - I will soon be adding a way to convert the decimal (m) into a fraction.

### Quick Note
  - I love Clang <3 My adventure with learning it has been a blast and I will continue to learn it.
  - This program may have issues!
